Thanks for sharing your README.md, Egor. You’ve clearly explained the purpose and structure of your ringtone archive — great job organizing it by year and UI.

Here’s a cleaner, slightly polished version with improved formatting and flow, while keeping your voice:

📱 Samsung Phonetones by UI (2009–2025)
Huge thanks to:

Without this source, this project wouldn’t be possible!

📂 What is this?
A full repository of Samsung ringtones and notification tones, sorted by user interface (UI) — from 2009 to 2025.
Whether it’s TouchWiz, Grace UX, or One UI, this archive helps you find the tone you remember — fast.

🤔 Why did I make this?
Finding ringtones can be a mess.

Let’s say:

You remember a tone from your old Samsung, but forget the model.

Or you want to make a video like "Evolution of Samsung Message Tones."

Normally, you'd have to search device by device.
With this repo, you just think: “Hmm, that was around 2013…”
Then go to the 2013 folder, and boom — there it is.

🛠️ How it works
📅 Ringtones are sorted by year, which also roughly maps to UI version.

📁 Inside each folder, there’s a README.md explaining what’s in that folder.

📄 The Misc folder contains rare tones and non-UI-specific tones. It includes a markdown file listing default tones per device (not a full README, but still useful).

⚠️ Note:
Some Samsung devices did not receive updated ringtones, even after a UI update.
Example: My old Galaxy S3 got the Premium Suite, but never got the new Nature UX ringtones.

There are also special cases, like:

💜 BTS Edition ringtones

💼 Business models with unique tones

Let me know if you want this version added to your repo, or if you'd like help improving the per-folder README.md files too.
