Without yall, it wouldnt be possible!

What?
Samsung phonetones repository, sorted by UI. UI's from 2009-2025.

Why?
Navigating phonetones can be difficult. Heres a few examples. If you want to reminiscence a ringtone you had on your old phone but dont remember the exact model, you can think a little when did you use that ringtone and find it in my repository. Theese are sorted by year. If you want to make a video like (Evolution of samsung message tone) or something, you need to spend extra time researching. If they are sorted by UI, its easier.

How?
Its easy! The ringtones are sorted by year, so if you want a ringtone from 2013, you can just look at 2013. Ahh i found it. If you ringtone is other OS or not found, you can look at the Misc directory.
In every directory there's a readme.md (IM NOT JOKING). This will tell you more about the directory you are currently in. An exception is the "Misc." directory. It has an .md file, but not powerful enough to be a readme.md. Its a list of default ringtones of each device.

PS: If your device is updated (example: Samsung Galaxy S3 (my old phone) was updated to Nature UX Premium Suite but didnt get the Nature UX Premium Suite ringtones). Some exceptions are BTS Over the Horizon ringtones.
