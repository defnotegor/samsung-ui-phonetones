Ported from Samsung Galaxy S6.
Removed UI sounds, and removed those stupid symlinks (idk who even put those here). TouchWiz versions starting with 4.0 will not have any /alarms directory. The reason for that is that stupid Samsung instead of creating new, unique alarm sounds, the sneaky company just borrows them from the /ringtones directory.
