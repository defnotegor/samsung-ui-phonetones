Ported from Samsung Galaxy A15 4G.
Removed UI sounds. We in 2023 thought that OneUI Core came to its end when people saw no "OneUI Core version" in the text of the "About phone" section of the settings. Oh boy they were wrong. Yes OneUI Core ended with 32 bit support and now, full 64 bit support. Yes some midrange features of the A3x series were added. But we have ONE question. Why didnt they do that for the ringtones? Mind you, the ringtones dont really matter on budget hardware (except if its some A01 core ofc). Oh and btw, the SoundThemes just mention the Over The Horizon ringtones.
